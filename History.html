    <p>WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment, formally WWF) is an American entertainment company known for Professional Wrestling. 
        Originally founded by Vincent J. McMahon, it later was bought out by his son <strong>Vincent K. McMahon</strong> in 1982. 
        Under McMahon’s leadership the WWF prospered and brought the <em>‘Golden Age’</em> of professional wrestling to the United States, with such stars as <em>Hulk Hogan, ‘Rowdy’ Roddy Piper, The Iron Shiek</em> and <em>‘Macho  Man’ Randy Savage.</em>
        During this time, the WWF also broke away from the NWA<em>(National Wrestling Alliance)</em>who had to this point, been governing all wrestling promotions in North America. 
        Without the NWA, WWF was free to go national, free from the constraints of NWA territories and produce the first edition of the Pay-Per-View event, <em><strong>WrestleMainia.</em></strong> </p>

        <h2 id = "New-Generation">The New Generation Era</h2>
        <p>Despite the popularity of the promotion in the 80’s, at the beginning of the 90’s WWF saw a loss of viewership. 
            This was due to bad press surrounding the WWF such as allegations of steroid abuse and distribution among the promotions talent and by McMahon himself. 
            To try and counter-act this, they began promoting new, young stars such as <em>Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker</em> and <em>Razor Ramon.</em> </p>

           <p>In January 1993 WWF launched it’s flagship show <em><strong>Monday Night Raw</strong></em>. 
            However in 1995 rival promotion WCW <em>(World Championship Wrestling)</em> launched it’s own show <em>Monday Night Nitro</em>, airing at the same time as Monday Night Raw. 
            This started what is now know as the <strong>Monday Night War</strong>. 
            Both companies competed to have the highest rating for their show each week, which was largely fuelled by WCW’s producer Eric Bishoff and their stable; the <em>nWo (New World Order)</em>, which was comprised of former WWF stars,<em>Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (formally known as Razor Ramon)</em> and <em>Kevin Nash (formally known as Diesel)</em>. 
            </p>

    <h2 id =  "Attitude-Era">The Attitude Era</h2>
    <p>As the Monday War continued, Raw would become a more adult-orientated product to compete with Nitro. 
        This was helped by backstage producers such as Vince McMahon’s son, Shane, and head writer <em>Vince Russo.</em> </p>

        </figure>
        <p>It is widely reported that the Attitude Era began with the departure of New Generation star Bret Hart during a controversy known as <strong><em> The Montreal Screwjob.</em></strong>
        After winning the company’s top belt, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Hart had chosen to leave the company for WCW after contract negotiations had broke down between him and McMahon. 
        Seeing his exit, McMahon requested that he lose the belt to Shawn Michaels at the companies upcoming Pay-Per-View <em>Survivor Series</em> in Montreal Canada, Hart’s home country. 
        Hart had refused sighting the personal difficulties between himself and Michaels. 
        Vince had agreed, stating that he would let the match end in disqualification. 
        However, behind the scenes Vince colluded with Michaels, other wrestling star Triple H and referee Earl Hepner, to force Hart to drop the belt. 
        During the match, Michaels put Hart in his own signature submission move the <em>Sharpshooter</em>. 
        Despite Hart not submitting, Earl Hepner signalled to officials to ring the bell and crown Michaels as the new champion. 
        After Michaels immediate exit from the ring with the belt Hart spelled out the letters WCW to the camera and spit on Vince McMahon , who had been watching the match at ringside. 
        Afterwards Hart sought out McMahon again which ended up in a physical brawl.</p>

        </figure>
    <p>Not only is this said to be the beginning of the attitude era but the birth of the onscreen character of <em>Mr. McMahon’</em>. 
        Until this point it wasn’t widely known about McMahons ownership of the company, only appearing onscreen a handful of times as a commentator or a viewer. 
        The audience, after understanding what had transpired began to hate Vince, which Vince used to become an on-screen villain character, using the phrase ‘Bret screwed Bret’ to gain more hatred. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>Various ex-WCW talent became the focus of the Attitude Era including, <em>‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin, Mick Foley (who portrayed three different on-screen characters; Dude Love, Cactus Jack and Mankind)</em> and <em>Vader</em>. 
        As well as this WWF’s own stars, <em>The Rock, Kane</em> and the stable <em>D-Generation X (Made up of Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Chyna, X-Pac, Billy Gunn and Road Dogg)</em>. With these new stars brought mainstream attention to the promotion and finally gave WWF the winning edge in the ratings war.
        This also brought a new WWF television show <strong><em>Smackdown!</em> </strong>in 1999. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>By 2001, WCW had dropped considerably in ratings and due to of change of ownership in Tuner Broadcasting (The company which owned the channel TNT, where Nitro aired every week) WCW had been pulled from broadcast. 
            Now extremely devalued, Vince McMahon purchased the company, several of it’s wrestlers and it’s video library for an extremely reduced value. Also, with this he bought ECW <em>(Extreme Championship Wrestling)</em>, which had been also greatly devalued due to declining ratings. 
            This is said to be the beginning of the end for the Attitude Era as no longer was WWF fighting for ratings with other promotions. </p>

            <p>In 2002 WWF was forced to change its name from World Wrestling Federation to <strong>World Wrestling Entertainment</strong> due to a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund. </p>

            <h2 id = "Ruthless-Agression">The Ruthless Agression Era</h2>
    <p>In March 2002, WWE decided to create two different rosters. 
        One group of stars to be exclusively featured on RAW and the other group to be featured on Smackdown, known as the <strong>brand-extension.</strong> 
        This was to showcase more talent from the now greatly bloated roster (Due to purchase of talent from WCW and ECW).
        The term ‘Ruthless Aggression’ came from a June 2002 promo from Vince McMahon in which he gave an impassioned speech to the Raw roster. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src='2002roster.jpg' alt='image of the Raw and SmackDown rosters in 2002' />
            <figcaption id = "caption-text">Raw and SmackDown rosters after the 2002 brand-extension</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>WWE were now producing their own talents in their training promotion OVW <em>(Ohio Valley Wrestling).</em> This produced Ruthless Aggression stars such as <em>John Cena, Brock Lesner, Randy Orton</em> and <em>Batista</em>. 
        As well as this you had ex-WCW and ex-ECW talent such as, <em>Eddie Guerrero, Rob Van Dam, Booker T</em> and<em> Rey Mysterio.</em> </p>

            <img src='cena us champion.jpg' alt='image of John Cena with the US Championship' />
            <figcaption id = "caption-text">John Cena with the US Championship belt</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>While this era was adult-orientated, it was considerably toned down from the Attitude era. 
        This did not exempt it from controversies though.
        The most notable during this time is the <strong>Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide.</strong> 
        On June 25th 2007 Fayette County police were notified of three bodies in the residence of prominent WWE star Chris Benoit. 
        It was discovered that Benoit had killed his wife, Nancy and seven-year-old son, Daniel, then proceeded to kill himself. 
        In the following years it has been speculated that a mix of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy, caused by repeated blows to the head), steroids and the death of his friend, Eddie Guerrero, is what led Benoit to do this. 
        Following this WWE implemented a new ‘Wellness Policy’ which covered the use of steroids, drugs and injuries caused by wrestling. 
        They also banned direct steel chair shots to head and toned down the violence, swearing and sexual content of it’s programming. </p>

        </figure>
        In 2006 WWE launched it’s third brand, a revival of the defunct promotion ECW. 
        Figure-Head for this brand was <em>Paul Heyman</em>, former head booker of ECW.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <h2 id = "PG-Era">The PG Era</h2>
    <p>In the summer of 2008 WWE began to tone down it’s content even more and began to have a PG rating, rather than TV-14. 
    This Caused practises, such as <strong>blading</strong> (purposely cutting the forehead to make yourself bleed, to make certain matches more impactful) and adult story content were phased out entirely. </p>
    <p>This era saw the rise of the star CM Punk, who had debuted with the company under the ECW brand. 
        During a feud with other top star, John Cena, Punk coined one of the most famous wrestling promos, known as the <em><strong> Pipe-Bomb Promo</strong></em>. 
        In this, Punk spoke about his mistreatment by the company and their tendencies to feature other older stars, such as The Rock or Cena himself, and not build upcoming stars. 
        This is most notable because this one of the first time that a wrestler has directly broken <em>kayfabe</em> (The practice of portraying the events in wrestling as real-life events) on Television. 
        CM Punk became WWE’s first instance of being forced to push a wrestler due to the demands of fans. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src='pipebomb.jpg' alt='image of CM Punk during the Pipebomb Promo' />
            <figcaption id = "caption-text">CM Punk during the Pipe-Bomb Promo</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Other notable events in this era was the establishment of a new programme called <strong>NXT.</strong> 
        The premise was that eight new stars would be mentored by other, more established, stars. 
        This was done in a reality-show like format. The biggest stars to come from this were <em>Wade Barrett</em> and <em>Daniel Bryan.</em>
        Following this first run of the show, NXT transformed into the new developmental territory, FCW <em>(Florida Championship Wrestling)</em> to train new stars. 
        The name would eventually be changed back to NXT and be given a weekly television spot.  </p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
        <h2 id = "Reality-Era">The Reality Era</h2>
    <p>In 2013, Daniel Bryan become the most popular star among fans. 
        Bryan coined the ‘Yes’ chant further feeding into his ‘good guy’ character. 
        Often fans would begin a ‘Yes’ chant when Bryan was not present. 
        With social-media now prominent in wrestling fans began to have more input and were more knowledgeable about the behind-the-scenes working of wrestling. 
        The full impact of this was felt when WWE received backlash over fans considering the booking of Daniel Bryan to be sub-par. 
        The audience believed that WWE was not pushing this new star in favouring of putting over other talents such as Batista and Randy Orton. 
        This forced WWE to changed plans for their biggest Pay-Per-View, WrestleMania, that year and crown Bryan as WWE Champion. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src='yesbryan.jpg' alt='image of Daniel Byran doing a Yes Chant' />
            <figcaption id = "caption-text">Daniel Byran doing a 'Yes' chant</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>During the same time the company saw the departure of CM Punk. 
            Siting mistreatment by the company. Punk walked out the company after reaching out for unpaid royalties and mistreatment of a Staph infection by WWE’s medical team. Punk has since retired from wrestling all together. 
            This caused outrage among the fans and a shift in audience opinion towards WWE.</p>
    <p>Other noteworthy events from this time was Brock Lesner beating the Undertakers WrestleMania undefeated record and WrestleMaina 32 garnering the largest crowd in WWE history with 100,000 attendees.  </p>

    <h2 id = "New-Era">The New Era</h2>
    <p>Today WWE is quite different from it’s original product. 
        Unofficially dubbed as the New Era, it has brought various changes, the biggest being it’s women’s division.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src='womenbelts.jpg' alt='image of the raw and smackdown womens championships' />
            <figcaption id = "caption-text">The RAW and SmackDown women's championships</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Previously known as the Divas division, the new Women’s division has two main championships, the Raw Women’s Championship and the SmackDown Women’s Championship. 
        This brought more air-time and more focus the women’s division, a far cry from three minute comedy matches that was a staple of previous eras. 
        In 2016 stars Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks became the first women to main event a Pay-Per-View. 
        Male only match stipulations like <em>Money in the Bank</em> and <em>Royal Rumble’</em> now had women’s equivalents and in 2018 WWE held a women’s only Pay-Per-View named <em><strong>Evolution.</strong></em> </p>

            <figcaption id = "caption-text">The participants of the Pay Per View Evolution</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>During this time, the <strong>WWE Network</strong> was established. 
            It was a subscription based service with gave customers access to WWE’s tape library and Pay-Per-Views and well as tape libraries from other promotions such as ECW and WCW. </p>
