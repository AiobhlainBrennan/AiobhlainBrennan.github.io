            <p>WWE superstar Edge added another glorious chapter to his comeback story after winning the men's Royal Rumble match from the number one position.</p>
        <p>Edge was announced as the number 2 entrant on the WWE Backstage special Saturday night, but the Rumble was once again amended for Edge to start as the number 1 entrant. 
            Edge last eliminated 'The Viper' Randy Orton, who spent the majority of the match selling a knee injury backstage before returning at the end.</p>

          <p>Carlito has admitted he is unsure whether he has a future in WWE, after making a surprise return at the 2021 Royal Rumble. 

            Carlito appeared on WWE programming for the first time in ten years at the 2021 pay-per-view event, having been released by the company in 2010 for first violation of the WWE Wellness Program and his subsequent refusal to attend a rehabilitation facility.
            
            The 41-year-old admitted his departure from WWE had left a bitter taste in his mouth and he was excited to have the opportunity to reappear last month, and make amends for the wrongs from a decade ago. </p>

          <h2>Seth Rollins BRUTALLY Assaults Cesaro During WWE SmackDown Return</h2>

      </figure>
          <p>The 'Messiah' has returned!

            Seth Rollins made his first appearance on regular WWE TV since before Survivor Series 2020 on last night's episode of SmackDown. At first, Rollins appeared to be a new man - he used the birth of his first child alongside Becky Lynch as an example of how he had changed.
            
            Of course, it was all a ruse.
            
            Seth then launched into a verbal attack on the watching SmackDown roster and said they needed a leader who could guide them on the proper path. That naturally led to walkouts from those who have heard it all before. When Rollins spotted Cesaro (who was one of the last to leave) walking away, he darted from the ring and viciously attacked him.
            
            Moments later, Daniel Bryan rushed to the Swiss star's aid and helped fend Rollins off. It appears that Seth will feud with both Cesaro and Bryan, which should lead to some tasty, tasty matches over the next few months.</p>

            <h2>WWE Legend Calls Raw's Lana "A Complete Pro"</h2>
            <p>Bully Ray thinks people need to show Lana some more respect.

          </figure><br>

              The WWE Hall Of Famer lavished compliments on the Raw star via his 'Busted Open Radio' show, and said everyone needs to realise how hard she's working to improve in-ring. That's not something Ray believes should ever be taken for granted, especially when Lana probably doesn't have to become a top-tier worker anyway.
              
              Bully noted that Lana will likely never be as good as talents like Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair, Bayley or Sasha Banks, but he loves that she puts a shift in and "invests time in her profession". Ray is also impressed that Lana "never [looks] boo-boo faced about anything" WWE ask her to do during segments and matches.</p>
